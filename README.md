## Project: Password Manager
### By: Jordan Wilson

# About: 
This is a project that I created that emphasizes the importance of security with passwords. I have created this project to allow users to safely store there passwords associated with websites in an offline program on their local machine. This should keep the users passwords secure as they won't be held online in a database ran by company with the risk of their passwords being involved in a data breach. Please feel free to check out the repo and let me know what you think. Thanks!
