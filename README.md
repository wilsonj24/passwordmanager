## Project: Password Manager
### By: Jordan Wilson

# About: 
This is a project that I created that emphasizes the importance of security with passwords. I have created this project to allow users to safely store there passwords associated with websites in an offline program on their local machine. This should keep the users passwords secure as they won't be held online in a database ran by a third-party company with the risk of their passwords being involved in a data breach and this should allow users to use a variety of different passwords as they don't need to remember all of them. Please feel free to check out the repo and let me know what you think. Thanks!


# How to run:
Simply clone the repo on you local machine. Make sure you have python installed. Once you have python and the repo on your machine, simply navigate to the program and run it. From here you now have access to the program. First you are going to have to make an account. Once you do so, you will be asked to log back in. After you have done that, you can now simply just add passwords to the websites where you have accounts. I hope you enjoy!
